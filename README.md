# HybridMutualFund

A hybrid fund is an investment fund that is characterized by diversification among two or more asset classes. These funds typically invest in a mix of stocks and bonds. The term hybrid indicates that the fund strategy includes investment in multiple asset classes. These funds offer investors an option for investing in multiple asset classes through a single fund. These funds can offer varying levels of risk tolerance ranging from conservative to moderate and aggressive.
Aim: To Analyse various parameters related to the Hybrid Mutual fund dataset and find distinction between good and bad schemes

Skewness:

 skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable about its mean. The skewness value can be positive or negative, or undefined.

Negative skew

commonly indicates that the tail is on the left side of the distribution; the mass of the distribution is concentrated on the right of the figure

Positive skew

indicates that the tail is on the right; the mass of the distribution is concentrated on the left of the figure.

A zero value

means that the tails on both sides of the mean balance out overall; this is the case for a symmetric distribution,

Alpha:

   Alpha tells you whether that fund has produced returns justifying the risks it is taking by comparing its actual return to the one 'predicted' by the beta.

Beta:

   Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility in relation to the market. By definition, the market has a beta of 1.0, and individual stocks are ranked according to how much they deviate from the market. A stock that swings more than the market over time has a beta above 1.0. If a stock moves less than the market, the stock's beta is less than 1.0. High-beta stocks are supposed to be riskier but provide a potential for higher returns; low-beta stocks pose less risk but also lower returns.

Standard Deviation:

 Standard deviation is a statistical measurement that shows how much variation there is from the arithmetic mean (simple average). A greater standard deviation indicates higher volatility, which means the mutual fund's performance fluctuated high above the average but also significantly below it.

R-squared

 R-squared measures how closely each change in the price of an asset is correlated to a benchmark. Beta measures how large those price changes are in relation to a benchmark. Used together, R-squared and beta give investors a thorough picture of the performance of asset managers.

Kurtosis:

Kurtosis is a statistical measure that defines how heavily the tails of a distribution differ from the tails of a normal distribution. In other words, kurtosis identifies whether the tails of a given distribution contain extreme values.
For kurtosis, the general guideline is that if the number is greater than +1, the distribution is too peaked. Likewise, a kurtosis of less than â€“1 indicates a distribution that is too flat.

Arbitrage:

 Arbitrage funds are for investors who want to profit from volatile markets without taking on too much risk. They are low risk funds where each security is bought and sold simultaneously and there is virtually none of the risk involved with longer-term investments. Arbitrage funds are not very profitable during stable markets. These are beneficial when the market is highly volatile.

Conservative:

The conservative hybrid schemes are mandated to invest 10 to 25 per cent of their total assets in equity and equity-related instruments. The rest (75 per cent to 90 per cent) of the corpus will be invested in debt instruments. The little exposure to equity helps these schemes to earn little extra returns than pure debt funds. This also makes these schemes riskier than the pure debt funds.

Aggressive:

  Aggressive Hybrid Funds will invest 65% to 80% of total assets in equities and 20% to 35% in debt instruments. These schemes are treated as equity schemes for the purpose of taxation. Aggressive growth funds seek to provide above average market returns and are more promising of the lot.

Crisil Rating:

    Crisil rating is based on global best practices which uses a combination of NAV and portfolio-based attributes for evaluation. This provides a single point analysis of mutual funds, taking into consideration key parameters such as risk-adjusted returns, asset concentration, liquidity and asset quality.

->This pie chart shows that out of my 30 schemes, funds having rank 1 are 10%, of rank 2 are 33.3%, of rank 3 are 40%, of rank 4 are 6.7% and of rank 5 are 10%.

Rank 1 being the highest and rank 5 being the lowest, Rank or Crisil rating is based on global best practices which uses a combination of NAV and portfolio-based attributes for evaluation. This provides a single point analysis of mutual funds, taking into consideration key parameters such as risk-adjusted returns, asset concentration, liquidity and asset quality.
